# Subscription & Purchase Intelligence Hub üß†üí∏

**Submitted for the Postmark Challenge: Inbox Innovators!**

Tired of sifting through emails to find out how much you're spending on subscriptions or why you made a particular purchase? The Subscription & Purchase Intelligence Hub transforms your email inbox into a smart financial command center!

This application automatically parses your forwarded e-receipts and relevant discussion emails, extracts key financial data using AI, identifies contextual insights (like reasons for purchase, issues, or sentiment from discussions), and links them together. View your consolidated financial intelligence on a personalized dashboard and get smart updates via Slack.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Financial Parsing:** Uses OpenAI (GPT models) to accurately extract vendor names, product details, prices, currencies, dates, billing cycles, and categories from a wide variety of financial emails.
- **Contextual Intelligence Engine:**

  - Performs **Sentiment Analysis** on context highlights (positive, negative, neutral) to provide deeper understanding.
  - Automatically links relevant context and discussion insights to your financial items.
- **No User Accounts Needed (Implicit User ID):** Simply forward your emails! The system uses your forwarding email address (`owner_email`) to organize and display _your_ data.
- **Personalized Web Dashboard (React):**
  - Enter your `owner_email` to view your private financial hub.
  - Displays a clear list of financial items with their original and USD-converted amounts.
  - Showcases linked "Context Highlights" alongside each financial item, complete with sentiment indicators (e.g., üëçüëéüòê).
